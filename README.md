# About NextJS Boilerplate 2022

This boilerplate contains SASS support, Redux Toolkit, Prisma ORM, Airbnb ESlint and Prettier integration.
It was created to make your life easier and to have a starting point for any scalable project.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have docker installed and run `$ yarn setup`. This script will install the project, setup Prisma, create a docker PostgreSQL container and migrate the database. A whole setup in one command.

2. You are ready to go.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
